SurfaceFlickrSearch is a simple Flickr Search Client for Microsoft Surface 2.0, demonstrating the capabilities of the Microsoft Surface 2.0 SDK.
To run this application, you have to edit Settings.xml and provide a valid Flickr API key in the <FlickrApiKey></FlickrApiKey> element.
To display the search GUI, you have to place the Byte Tag specified in Settings.xml on the Surface unit running the application.
You can print your own Byte Tags by downloading them from: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11029
You can also use the Surface Simulator on any computer to simulate placing a Byte Tag on the running application.
